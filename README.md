# Aim
We want to find companies with complex ownership structures in the UK. To do so, we will construct a graph database showing the relationships between various companies and their owners

# Data
We begin with publicly available data, which can be obtained [here](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_pscdata.html)
